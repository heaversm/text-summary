      <p>As I look back on the events of that interminable hot summer of <span class="personalized" data-id="birth-year">1976</span>, that summer when <span class="personalized" data-id="country">England</span> reeled, gasping for breath, pole-axed by the unending heat — now I know what my <span class="personalized" data-id="mother">mother</span> was talking about: I understand that bitter dark current of fear that flowed beneath the placid surface of <span class="personalized" data-id="gender-possessive">her</span> ordinary life — how it had never left <span class="personalized" data-id="gender-possessive">her</span> even after years of peaceful, unexceptionable living. I now realise <span class="personalized" data-id="gender">she</span> was always frightened that someone was going to come and kill <span class="personalized" data-id="gender-possessive">her</span>. And <span class="personalized" data-id="gender-possessive">she</span> had good reason. </p>

      <p>It all started, I remember, in early June. I can't recall the exact day - a Saturday, most likely, because <span class="personalized" data-id="child-name">Jochen</span> wasn't at <span class="personalized" data-id="gender-possessive-child">his</span> nursery school - and we both drove over to <span class="personalized" data-id="nearby-1">Middle Ashton</span> as usual. We took the main road out of <span class="personalized" data-id="hometown">Oxford</span> to <span class="personalized" data-id="nearby-2">Stratford</span> and then turned off it at <span class="personalized" data-id="nearby-3">Chipping Norton</span>, heading for <span class="personalized" data-id="nearby-4">Evesham</span>, and then we turned off again and again, as if we were following a descending scale of road types; <span class="personalized" data-id="road-names">trunk road, road, B-road, minorroad</span>, until we found ourselves on the metalled cart track that led through the dense and venerable beech wood down to the narrow valley that contained the tiny village of <span class="personalized" data-id="nearby-1">Middle Ashton</span>. It was a journey I made at least twice a week and each time I did so I felt I was being led into the lost heart of <span class="personalized" data-id="country">England</span> — a green, forgotten, inverse Shangri-La where everything became older, mouldier and more decrepit.</p>
