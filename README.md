### Text Summarizer / Reader

This is a tool which takes a body of text and summarizes it to a length specified by the reader. It can then highlight keywords within the summary, and read the text via a variable speed reader similar to [squirt](http://squirt.io).

The application is really just a combination of a number of great NLP-related projects, accredited below:
